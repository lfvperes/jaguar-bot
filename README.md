This project consists in a Twitter Bot that searches for, stores and posts jaguar pictures. It is written in Node.JS and it is constantly being updated and improved.

Albeit the project is far from completed, a release is intended to happen simply because the main basic bot features are ready and can be useful to other projects. It is a project of great importance for the author and, as such, needs to be showcased.

### APIs used:
- Twitter API
- Google Custom Search JSON API
### Node.JS libraries used:
- Image Downloader
- Node Twitter

Technically, the bot *works* and its deployment was tested on Heroku. Nevertheless, as of now, the bot is not online and won't be until it can fully operate on its own.

The progress can be tracked on [this GitKraken Board](https://app.gitkraken.com/glo/board/YBhZjZOeNgARRwSK).

*Disclaimer: This readme still needs updating.*
